<!-- http methods -->
It stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
It used to enable the communication between client and server.
It works like request-response protocol between client and server.
 For example, If client(browser) sends request to server, then server will respond with the data.

 There are 6 types of HTTP methods,
GET: used to get data from server
POST: used to send data to server to create/update a resource
PUT: used to send data to server to create/upadate a resource   
    //Diff betwee PUT and POST is, if you call PUT request with same data again, it will update the resource with same data, 
    but POST will create a new resource with same data which leads to multiple resource with same data.
PATCH: used to update partial data to server
HEAD: identical to GET , the difference is it will not return the response body, only contains the head details
DELETE: used to delete data from server

Here are some status codes,
200 : ok
201: created
400: bad request
401: unauthorized
404: not found
500: internal server error
502: bad gateway
